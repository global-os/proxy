# WebViews

A WebView is a proxied `<iframe>` that a `.gapp` app can embed to load external URLs through the GlobalOS backend. The backend fetches upstream pages, applies a per-WebView rule set to each response, and returns rewritten content.

## Origin

GlobalOS started as a domain-rewriting proxy (`index.js` → `src/replace.ts`). WebViews are that original vision expressed as a first-class platform primitive owned by a process.

## URL structure

WebViews share `*.app.onetrueos.com` with instances. The router checks `instances.slug` first, then `webviews.slug`. Slugs are short random strings (8–12 chars), not UUIDs — no collision in practice.

Each WebView is bound to an upstream domain at creation time. The proxy URL is path-only:

```
https://{webviewId}.app.onetrueos.com/some/page
```

The proxy looks up the WebView row to find the upstream domain, then fetches `https://{domain}/some/page`.

Cross-domain links are rewritten to point to the *target domain's own WebView* (if one is registered via a `remap` rule). Each domain gets its own slug and therefore its own subdomain and cookie jar:

```html
<!-- upstream -->  <a href="https://cdn.wellsfargo.com/logo.png">
<!-- rewritten --> <a href="https://salakfjds.app.onetrueos.com/logo.png">
```

This means root-relative paths in cross-domain resources resolve correctly — `salakfjds.app.onetrueos.com` is bound to `cdn.wellsfargo.com`, so `url('/fonts/roboto.woff')` in a stylesheet fetched through `salakfjds` correctly resolves to `cdn.wellsfargo.com/fonts/roboto.woff`.

If a cross-domain link has no `remap` rule, it is proxied through the current WebView with the domain as the first path segment (e.g. `r7kx2mqp.app.onetrueos.com/unexpected.com/path`). Root-relative paths in those resources will resolve against the wrong domain, but this is the fallback for domains the app hasn't explicitly mapped.

## Schema

```sql
webview (
  id         serial PRIMARY KEY,
  slug       text NOT NULL UNIQUE,   -- 8–12 char random string; becomes subdomain
  process_id integer NOT NULL → process(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  domain     text NOT NULL,          -- upstream domain this WebView is bound to
  created_at timestamp
)

webview_rule (
  id         serial PRIMARY KEY,
  webview_id integer NOT NULL → webview(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ord        integer NOT NULL,       -- evaluation order; first match wins
  match      jsonb NOT NULL,
  action     jsonb NOT NULL
)
index on (webview_id, ord)
```

A request to an unknown slug gets a 404 — you cannot reach a WebView before it exists.

The bound `domain` is immutable — changing the domain would invalidate the cookie jar and break navigation state. Rules are mutable and can be updated at any time; the slug and cookie jar are preserved across rule changes.

## Rules

Each rule has a matcher and an action. Rules are evaluated in order; the first match wins per request.

```ts
type UrlMatcher =
  | { domain: string }   // any path under this hostname
  | { path: string }     // exact path (on the WebView's bound domain)
  | { prefix: string }   // path or URL starts with this string
  | { regex: string }    // full upstream URL tested against pattern

type RuleAction =
  | { type: "replace-body"; html: string }
    // Discard upstream response, return this HTML.
    // e.g. wellsfargo.com → "<html><body>hi bob</body></html>"

  | { type: "rewrite-links"; to: string }
    // Rewrite every <a href> to a fixed URL.
    // e.g. every link on google.com → "https://example.com"

  | { type: "rewrite-domain"; from: string; to: string }
    // Content-level: replace all domain references in the HTML response
    // (href, src, action, meta content, inline CSS urls) from `from` to `to`.
    // The content is still fetched from `from`; only the links in the output change.
    // The original feature from src/replace.ts.

  | { type: "remap"; domain: string; webviewId: string }
    // When a URL matching the matcher appears in proxied content, rewrite it to
    // point to a specific other WebView (which must already exist).
    // The successor to the original `domains` table: slug → { domain, webviewId }.
    // e.g. match: { domain: "bankofamerica.com" },
    //      remap → domain: "bankofamerica.com", webviewId: "abc123def4"
    // → links to bankofamerica.com route through abc123def4's proxy instead

  | { type: "block" }
    // Return empty 200. Useful for ads, trackers, unwanted subresources.
    // The default for any request with no matching rule is to proxy it through,
    // so block must be stated explicitly for domains you want to suppress.

  | { type: "passthrough" }
    // Explicit no-op. Lets a sub-path escape a broader domain rule.
```

Example rule set for a WebView bound to `wellsfargo.com`:

```json
[
  {
    "match": { "domain": "doubleclick.net" },
    "action": { "type": "block" }
  },
  {
    "match": { "domain": "bankofamerica.com" },
    "action": { "type": "remap", "domain": "bankofamerica.com", "webviewId": "abc123def4" }
  }
]
```

## Domain registry

A process maintains a named registry of domain bindings: `slug → { domain, webviewId }`. This is the direct successor to the original `domains` table — instead of mapping a slug to a cleartext domain, it maps a slug to a domain-plus-WebView pair.

```ts
// app → kernel
{ type: 'webview:create',       domain: string, rules: WebViewRule[] }
{ type: 'webview:update-rules', webviewId: string, rules: WebViewRule[] }
{ type: 'webview:destroy',      webviewId: string }
{ type: 'webview:bind',         slug: string, webviewId: string }
{ type: 'webview:unbind',       slug: string }
{ type: 'webview:resolve',      slug: string }

// kernel → app
{ type: 'webview:create:complete',       webviewId: string, domain: string, proxyOrigin: string }
{ type: 'webview:update-rules:complete', webviewId: string }
{ type: 'webview:resolve:complete',      slug: string, webviewId: string, domain: string, proxyOrigin: string }
```

The app can navigate by slug rather than raw ID:

```ts
{ type: 'webview:resolve', slug: 'wellsfargo' }
// → { webviewId: 'r7kx2mqp', domain: 'wellsfargo.com', proxyOrigin: 'https://r7kx2mqp.app.onetrueos.com' }
```

`remap` rules reference other WebViews by raw ID. The target WebView must already exist when a request triggers the rule — the process is responsible for creating all WebViews before wiring up cross-domain remap rules.

## Cookie isolation

Each WebView is its own subdomain, so the browser isolates cookies automatically — `r7kx2mqp.app.onetrueos.com` and `abc123.app.onetrueos.com` are distinct origins. Isolation is per-WebView, not per-process: two WebViews within the same process bound to the same upstream domain get entirely separate cookie jars.

The proxy must strip the `Domain` attribute from `Set-Cookie` headers so upstream domains don't attempt to set cookies on `.app.onetrueos.com`:

```
Set-Cookie: session=abc; Domain=wellsfargo.com; Path=/
→
Set-Cookie: session=abc; Path=/
```

## Download interception

The proxy inspects every response before forwarding. A response is a download candidate if:

- `Content-Disposition: attachment` is present, OR
- `Content-Type` is non-renderable (`application/octet-stream`, `application/zip`, `application/x-tar`, any MIME type the browser would save rather than display)

On a download hit: discard the body, return a minimal HTML page that fires a postMessage to the parent frame:

```js
window.parent.postMessage({
  type: 'webview:download',
  webviewId: 'r7kx2mqp',
  filename: 'report.pdf',  // from Content-Disposition filename=, or null
  mimeType: 'application/pdf',
  url: 'https://wellsfargo.com/report.pdf',
  size: 182400             // from Content-Length, or null
}, '*')
```

The app receives this, prompts the user, and can save via the `fs.saveDesktopFile` syscall (re-fetching through the proxy as a normal GET).

## Kernel message API — events from the WebView iframe

```ts
// webview iframe → app (window.parent.postMessage, cross-origin)
{ type: 'webview:download', webviewId, filename, mimeType, url, size }
{ type: 'webview:error',    webviewId, message }
```

The kernel validates that `webviewId` belongs to the sending process before forwarding any message.

## What is not in scope (yet)

- `rewrite-links` templates (`"to": "https://example.com?orig={href}"`) — literal URL only for now
- CSS/JS content rewriting — rules apply to HTML responses only; non-HTML passes through or gets blocked
- Per-WebView request headers (custom User-Agent, etc.) — could be a rule action later
- WebView-to-WebView communication
